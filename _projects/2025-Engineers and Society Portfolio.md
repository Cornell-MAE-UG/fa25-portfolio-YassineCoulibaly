Introduction: 

This portfolio synthesizes the learning activities and analyses completed during Weeks 6 through 9, all centered on the Boeing 737 MAX case. Across these weeks, the focus progressed from identifying ethical issues and stakeholders, to applying ethical frameworks, examining real-world constraints, and proposing prevention strategies. Together, these sections demonstrate an integrated understanding of ethical decision-making in complex engineering systems.

Week 6: Indentify Ethical Issues and Stakeholders 

Key Ethical Issues: 

The primary ethical issue identified in Week 6 was the approval and deployment of the MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) on the Boeing 737 MAX despite known risks. Critical concerns included the use of a single angle-of-attack sensor, limited pilot awareness, and insufficient training.

Stakeholders: 

- Primary stakeholders: Passengers, pilots, airlines, Boeing engineers, and FAA regulators
- Secondary stakeholders: Boeing executives, shareholders, victims’ families, and the general public.

Ethical Principles Involved:

- Protection of public safety
- Professional responsibility and honesty
- Transparency and informed consent
- Accountability of engineers and organizations

This week established the foundation by clarifying who was affected and why the decisions surrounding MCAS had serious ethical implications.


Week 7: Facts, Assumptions, and Definitions

Relevant Facts :

- MCAS was implemented to address stability issues cause by the larger engines. 
- The system relied on a single sensir and repeatedly activate. 
- Pilots were not fully informed about MCAS functionality.

Resonable Assumptions:

- Engineers raised concerns internally, but these concerns were minimized or overruled.
- Schedule pressure and cost reduction influenced design and certification decisions.
- Competitive pressure with Airbus shaped organizational priorities.

Definitional Clarifications:

Key terms such as safety, transparency, responsibility, and failure were analyzed from multiple perspectives:

    - Boeing’s perspective: Meeting regulatory requirements and maintaining competitiveness.
    - Victims’ families’ perspective: Full disclosure, accountability, and prioritization of human life.
    - FAA’s perspective: Regulatory compliance and oversight efficiency.

This week highlighted how differing definitions of ethical terms can significantly change ethical judgments.
