Introduction: 

This portfolio synthesizes the learning activities and analyses completed during Weeks 6 through 9, all centered on the Boeing 737 MAX case. Across these weeks, the focus progressed from identifying ethical issues and stakeholders, to applying ethical frameworks, examining real-world constraints, and proposing prevention strategies. Together, these sections demonstrate an integrated understanding of ethical decision-making in complex engineering systems.

Week 6: Indentify Ethical Issues and Stakeholders 

Key Ethical Issues: 

The primary ethical issue identified in Week 6 was the approval and deployment of the MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System) on the Boeing 737 MAX despite known risks. Critical concerns included the use of a single angle-of-attack sensor, limited pilot awareness, and insufficient training.

Stakeholders: 

- Primary stakeholders: Passengers, pilots, airlines, Boeing engineers, and FAA regulators
- Secondary stakeholders: Boeing executives, shareholders, victims’ families, and the general public.

Ethical Principles Involved:

- Protection of public safety
- Professional responsibility and honesty
- Transparency and informed consent
- Accountability of engineers and organizations

This week established the foundation by clarifying who was affected and why the decisions surrounding MCAS had serious ethical implications.


Week 7: Facts, Assumptions, and Definitions

Relevant Facts :

- MCAS was implemented to address stability issues cause by the larger engines. 
- The system relied on a single sensir and repeatedly activate. 
- Pilots were not fully informed about MCAS functionality.

Resonable Assumptions:

- Engineers raised concerns internally, but these concerns were minimized or overruled.
- Schedule pressure and cost reduction influenced design and certification decisions.
- Competitive pressure with Airbus shaped organizational priorities.

Definitional Clarifications:

Key terms such as safety, transparency, responsibility, and failure were analyzed from multiple perspectives:

- Boeing’s perspective: Meeting regulatory requirements and maintaining competitiveness.
- Victims’ families’ perspective: Full disclosure, accountability, and prioritization of human life.
- FAA’s perspective: Regulatory compliance and oversight efficiency.


This week highlighted how differing definitions of ethical terms can significantly change ethical judgments.


Week 8: Ethical Analysis Using Codes and Frameworks

Applicable Codes of Ethics: ASME/ NSPE/ ASCE Canons 

Key Issues Analyzed: 

- Additional training
- Standardized communication
- Prioritizing business relationships over public safety
- Engineers not voicing concerns
- Prioritizing competition over safety

Relevant Canons: 

- Canon 1: Hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.
- Canon 4: Act as faithful agents to employers.
- Canon 7: Issue public statements truthfully.

Conflicts: 

- Canon 4 conflicted with Canon 1 when engineers were pressured to prioritize company loyalty.
- Engineers faced pressure to certify systems quickly to reduce costs.

Conflicting Principles: 

- Loyalty to employer versus duty to protect public safety.
- Efficiency and competitiveness versus thorough testing and transparency.

Ethical Hierarchy: 

Across multiple analyses, the protection of public safety was consistently identified as the principle that must take precedence over organizational loyalty or financial concerns.

Ethical Evaluation: 

Approving MCAS with known limitations violated core engineering ethics principles, particularly the obligation to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public.


Week 9: Practical Constraints and Prevention Strategies

Practical Constraints Identified: 

- Organizational pressure to meet deadlines and reduce costs.
- Regulatory ambiguity due to FAA delegation.
- Limited communication and hierarchical barriers within Boeing.
- Competitive market pressure from Airbus.

Prevention Strategies:

Individual Level

- Enhanced ethics training for engineers and pilots.
- Anonymous reporting systems to encourage speaking up.

Organizational Level

- Separation of business and engineering decision-making.
- Stronger internal safety review boards.
- Improved transparency and communication across teams.

Systemic Level

- Reduced reliance on manufacturer self-certification.
- Stronger FAA oversight and global regulatory alignment.
- Industry-wide standards preventing safety from becoming a competitive disadvantage.

This week emphasized that ethical failures are rarely individual alone, but often systemic, requiring solutions at multiple levels.

Conclusion

The Weeks 6–9 activities collectively illustrate how ethical failures in engineering arise from a combination of technical decisions, organizational culture, and systemic pressures. Through structured ethical analysis, application of professional codes, and consideration of real-world constraints, this portfolio demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of engineering ethics and the importance of prioritizing public safety above all else.
