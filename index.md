## About Me


![Profile Picture](assets/images/profile-pic.jpg)

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University with a strong interest in automotive and motorsport engineering, driven by a passion for translating theory into practical, high-performance designs. Through hands-on experience in CAD, vehicle dynamics, and multidisciplinary team projects, I have developed a detail-oriented and systems-focused approach to engineering. I enjoy working through the full design lifecycle and thrive in collaborative environments where technical rigor and creativity intersect.

Take a look at my projects.
